======================

Utility methods for `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ to layout figures and axes
with fine control over absolute dimensions.

Main features
-------------

- Optimize whitespace in figures similar to :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.tight_layout`,
  but with better control over absolute dimensions and aspect ratios.
- Fix size of axes (rather than figures)
- Dynamically adjust figure height depending on axes aspect ratios.
- Control spacing in-between axes
- Add colorbars that properly stick to axes.
